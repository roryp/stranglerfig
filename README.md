# Modernizing Java Applications for Scalability, Maintainability, and Performance

## The Importance of Modernizing Java Applications

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, modernizing Java applications is crucial for achieving scalability, maintainability, and performance. Legacy systems often struggle to keep up with the demands of modern users and business requirements. By adopting modern architectural patterns, organizations can ensure their applications remain competitive and capable of handling increased workloads.

### Martin Fowler's Original Strangler Pattern

Martin Fowler introduced the Strangler Pattern as a way to incrementally replace parts of a legacy system with new functionality. The pattern is inspired by the strangler fig tree, which gradually grows around and replaces its host tree. This approach allows for a smooth transition from the old system to the new one without a complete rewrite.

#### Example: Martin Fowler's Strangler Pattern Code

```java
public class StranglerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LegacySystem legacySystem = new LegacySystem();
        ModernSystem modernSystem();

        String request = "someRequest";
        if (isModernRequest(request)) {
            modernSystem.handleRequest(request);
        } else {
            legacySystem.handleRequest(request);
        }
    }

    private static boolean isModernRequest(String request) {
        // Logic to determine if the request should be handled by the modern system
        return request.contains("modern");
    }
}

class LegacySystem {
    void handleRequest(String request) {
        System.out.println("Handling request in legacy system: " + request);
    }
}

class ModernSystem {
    void handleRequest(String request) {
        System.out.println("Handling request in modern system: " + request);
    }
}
```

Martin Fowler introduced the Strangler Pattern in his article "Strangler Fig Application" published on his website. You can read the original article [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html).

This example demonstrates how requests can be routed between the legacy and modern systems based on specific criteria, allowing for incremental modernization.

## The Benefits of the Strangler Pattern and Modern Web App Pattern

### The Strangler Pattern: Incremental Evolution

The **Strangler Pattern** is inspired by the strangler fig tree, which gradually takes over its host. Instead of a complete overhaul, you replace components of your legacy system incrementally. Here are some key benefits:

- **Minimized Risks**: Incremental changes reduce the likelihood of system-wide disruptions.
- **No Downtime**: Updates happen without halting the system, ensuring continued availability.
- **Parallel Operations**: Legacy and modern systems coexist during migration, providing flexibility for gradual transitions.

By isolating and routing traffic to new components selectively, the Strangler Pattern enables phased modernization.

### The Modern Web App Pattern: Foundation for Resilience

The **Modern Web App (MWA) Pattern** is like a blueprint for creating cloud-native, scalable applications. It emphasizes resilience, security, and scalability. Here are its core tenets:

- **Microservices**: Breaking monoliths into independently deployable components.
- **Containerization**: Ensuring consistency across diverse environments.
- **Cloud-Native Services**: Leveraging tools like **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** and **Azure App Service**.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Enabling Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

This pattern helps you adopt best practices for building modern, efficient applications tailored for the cloud.

## Implementing the Strangler Pattern and Modern Web App Pattern

### Combining Strangler and MWA Patterns

Imagine you're migrating a `/customer` endpoint from a legacy system to a modernized architecture. You can deploy a router that directs requests to either the old or new implementation based on specific conditions.

#### Example: Routing with Strangler Pattern

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class CustomerRouterController {
    private final LegacyCustomerService legacyService;
    private final ModernCustomerService modernService;

    public CustomerRouterController(LegacyCustomerService legacyService, ModernCustomerService modernService) {
        this.legacyService = legacyService;
        this.modernService = modernService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/customer")
    public ResponseEntity<Customer> getCustomer(@RequestParam String id) {
        if (isModernCustomer(id)) {
            Customer customer = modernService.getCustomerById(id);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(customer);
        }
        Customer customer = legacyService.getCustomerById(id);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(customer);
    }

    private boolean isModernCustomer(String id) {
        // Logic to determine if the request should be routed to the modern service
        return id.startsWith("MODERN_");
    }
}
```

This example uses a centralized router to direct requests based on specific criteria, such as the format of the customer ID. It enables both legacy and modernized systems to coexist during the transition.

### Comparison with the Reference App

The sample implementation in this repository is similar to the reference app provided in the [Modern Java Web App Patterns](https://github.com/azure/modern-web-app-pattern-java) repository. Both implementations use the strangler fig pattern for incremental modernization.

The reference app demonstrates how to apply the strangler fig pattern for Modern Web Applications (MWA). This pattern involves gradually replacing parts of a legacy system with new functionality, allowing for incremental modernization without disrupting the entire system. The sample implementation in this repository follows a similar approach, showcasing how to route requests between legacy and modern services based on specific criteria.

### Using Azure App Configuration for Feature Flags

The Modern Web App pattern reference sample uses Azure App Configuration to manage application settings and feature flags. Azure App Configuration is a managed service that provides a central place to manage application settings and feature flags. This is particularly useful in the context of the strangler fig pattern, as it allows for feature toggling and gradual rollout of new features.

#### Benefits of Azure App Configuration

- **Centralized Management**: Manage all your application settings and feature flags in one place.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Update configuration settings and feature flags without redeploying your application.
- **Feature Toggles**: Gradually roll out new features to users, reducing risk and ensuring a smooth transition.
- **Integration with Azure Services**: Seamlessly integrate with other Azure services like Azure Functions, Azure App Service, and more.

#### Example: Using Azure App Configuration

Here's an example of how you can use Azure App Configuration to manage feature flags in a Spring Boot application:

1. **Add Dependency**: Add the Azure App Configuration dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-spring-cloud-feature-management</artifactId>
    <version>xxxxxx</version>
</dependency>
```

2. **Configure App Configuration**: Add the following configuration to your `application.properties` file.

```properties
spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].endpoint=https://<your-app-configuration-name>.azconfig.io
spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].connection-string=<your-connection-string>
```

3. **Use Feature Flags**: Use the `@FeatureGate` annotation to enable or disable features based on feature flags.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class FeatureFlagController {

    @GetMapping("/feature")
    @FeatureGate(feature = "NewFeature")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getFeature() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("New Feature is enabled!");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use Azure App Configuration to manage feature flags and enable or disable features dynamically.
